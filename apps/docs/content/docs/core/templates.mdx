[^1]: Please note that if you're self-hosting a mail server you need port 25 to be open for SMTP (Mail Transmission Protocol that allows you to send and receive) to work properly. Some VPS providers like [Hetzner](https://docs.hetzner.com/cloud/servers/faq/#why-can-i-not-send-any-mails-from-my-server) block this port by default for new clients.
